Date: Jan 30, 2025

Comments: **Repo includes two branches** - the "Master" branch contains the code for tasks 1 and 2 main contains code for task 3


Current Branch (main): Contains three files:

 - header | Doubll.h
 
 - custom functions | Doubll.cpp
        
 - main program | main.cpp


FIRST OPEN THE FOLDER WHERE THESE THREE FILES ARE LOCATED

In CLI: 
        
To compile: 
        
        g++ main.cpp Doubll.cpp -o run               
 
To run: 
        
        ./run
